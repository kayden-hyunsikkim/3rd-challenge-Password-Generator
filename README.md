## Description

<p>This project was created to create an application to generate a random password. It contains notes on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>I create a application that can randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria. 
so that users can create a strong password that provides greater security.</p>
<p>I learned how to use APIs, how to make functions and use them. Also I learned how to google some APIs, functions etc to use for what I want to execute </p>
